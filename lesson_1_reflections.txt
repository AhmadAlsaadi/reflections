in this lesson I learned the following:
1-version control might be difficult at the beginning and then it will become much easier 
2-I learned how to use diff program which helps me find the changes that has been made in a file
by comparing the new version of a file to the old one by using the following command:
diff -u old_file new_file
3-In windows we can use FC to see the difference between two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
first it will not make me afread of making changes.
additionally, at any point in time I can restore my old code.
i also can find the bugs that I might introduce during my change to the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros: you do not worry when should you make a commit

cons: you do not have much control on the changes and you may run into large file of commits.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

first we use the git log to look at the ids and comments of the changes.
then we use the git diff with two commit ids to find the difference in the file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can return to the previous version whenever I want.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I will try to use git for all my future project. It is really helpful.
